## Principles of Universal Design
* <u><b>Principle 1: Equitable Use</b></u>  
This software has large font, colour contrast, and a simple, intuitive design,
making it accessible to people with a wide range of abilities.
* <u><b>Principle 2: Flexibility in Use</b></u>  
This software is designed to be highly flexible. It could be used by a variety
of different types of businesses. 
* <u><b>Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use</b></u>  
This software attempts to make all user interfaces as simple and easy to follow 
as possible. For example, the shift schedule is displayed in the format of a 
calendar, making it easy to understand what days shifts are on and how long 
they last.
* <u><b>Principle 4: Perceptible Information</b></u>  
This software uses many different modes to convey information in order to make 
it as legible as possible, regardless of the user’s sensory abilities or level 
of concentration. For example, the employee list conveys each employee’s status 
through both text and colour.
* <u><b>Principle 5: Tolerance for Error</b></u>  
This software has a high tolerance for error. Numerous failsafes are in place in
order to minimize the consequences of unintended actions. For instance, if a 
manager attempts to schedule a shift without entering a date, or a shift with an
end time before the start time, a pop-up warning will appear, prompting the user
to change the entered information.
* <u><b>Principle 6: Low Physical Effort</b></u>  
This software is designed to require a minimal amount of physical effort. Most 
of the controls in the software are in the form of buttons, making it easy to 
interact with, even for people with limited fine motor skills.
* <u><b>Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use</b></u>  
This software includes text displayed in large, readable fonts, making it easy 
for people with visual or cognitive impairments to read and interact with it.
## Target Demographic 
<p>
This software is targeted towards business owners, and is meant to be used by 
them and their employees. Therefore, the main group of people most likely to use
this software are people of working age, that is, between the ages of 16-65. 
Additionally, since the software contains only English text, it is mainly 
targeted towards English speakers. However, since both ‘business owner’ and 
‘employee’ are broad demographics, this software has been designed to 
accommodate the needs of users with a variety of ages and physical abilities.
</p>

## Demographics Less Likely to Use this Software
<p>
This software is less likely to be used by people not of working age, 
such as children or elderly people. It is also less likely to be used by 
non-English speakers, who may have trouble interpreting some of the 
instructions. Since this software is designed to allow people to easily 
manage teams of employees, it might not be used by people who are self-employed,
or who have highly specialized jobs.
