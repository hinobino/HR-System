User Stories:
1. **TEAM STORY**: A Manager creates an account on the system and logs in. From there, they can create
   new employees, which have user IDs. Employees can then activate an account using one of the
   created employee user IDs and choosing a password, and then log in.
2. **ANDY**: An employee wants time off, so they submit a request to their boss (Manager). Time off
   requests must be submitted at least 7 days in advance. The manager can then approve or deny the
   request and the employee can view their pending requests to see if they have been approved. If
   a request has been approved, the employee's existing shifts, if any, are removed.
3. **EMMETT**: Managers can view a list of all of their employees, and click on each one to view more
   information about them. They can view their employment period, hours worked, current pay, change
   their pay rate, fire them, etc. Employees can view their own information, including hours worked,
   pay for their scheduled shifts, etc.
4. **JAKE**: A manager wants to schedule an employee to work on a specific day. They can schedule a
   shift on a specific date, with the start and end time, as long as it is not a public holiday or
   outside of the company's working hours and assign employees to that shift (that are not currently
   on leave). They can also remove and modify existing shifts.
5. **MICHELLE**: Employees can view their current personal weekly schedule which includes their shifts
   and if any holidays occur. Managers can view the entire schedule for the week, including all of
   the employees' shifts, the employees who are working, and if any holidays occur.
6. **HINAR**: Employees and managers are able to download a .ics file of their schedule to import to
   their calendar application of choice. As well, any employees, managers, shifts, etc. are stored
   in a database that will be accessed by the HR system.
